        Valuable advantages appear with objective information acquired through
        sensors to maximize productivity and sustainability. Mobile applications
        are now a part of our daily life and offer facilities in almost every
        sector. But the agriculture-based applications are fewer and if there
        are any but have only 10-20 thousand plus downloads only and in a
        country like India where 50-65\% of people today depend on agriculture
        for their livelihood mainly and the farmers face losses in agriculture
        area leaving their occupation due to lack of knowledge and tools and the
        one main reason behind it is not even get enough profit that will help
        them to survive till next crop season. In the modern world majority of
        people own a mobile phone and also have internet connectivity so a
        specifically designed mobile application will help farmers in resolving
        the problem like lack of agriculture-based technical knowledge by
        providing a series of videos in their regional language to gain
        knowledge and giving information about the crops which are better suited
        for their farmland based on their soil and climate conditions,
        centralized selling and buying interface for crops and tools rentals and
        weather update and to resolve the queries by domain experts. A tool that
        will help them to check the moisture, and light intensity level, which
        are the major factors in crop growth, moisture has an impact on the
        availability of nutrients and of the plant's ability to take them up.
        Ample moisture levels are of high importance to yields.
